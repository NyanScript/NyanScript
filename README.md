  <b>NyanScript, a CL written on python</b>
</p>

<p>NyanScipt is a very functional, easy to learn and use language that will help you!, developed based on multiple scripts, is now here to bring you all you need</p>

<h2 align="center">.nyan Files</h2>

<p>Usually, on the shell and py, the .nyan files will run just like you want them to, but we're currently working on a plugin to make things easier</p>

```
nyan-shell.py
NyanCat🐱> RUN("cattest.nyan")
```

<p>Run that command on Nyan-shell or any other to test .nyan files functionality</>
  
  <h2 align="center">Test it yourself</h2>
  
  <p>On any (supported) Code editor, create a file with the ".nyan" termination</p>
  
  <p>To create a traditional "Hello World" code, do it just like you would on PY</p>
  
  ```

PRINT("Hello World")
```

<p>After saving the file, on the interactive "Nyan-Shell" or an interpreter, run:</p>

```
nyan-shell.py
NyanCat🐱> RUN("Your File Name.nyan")
```
<p>And your "Hello World" shall appear, to run it on a PY debugging console, just type</p>
  
  ```
VSCODE-PYTHON-CONSOLE
py>> RUN("Your File Name.nyan")
```
